# MALT: Malware Analysis Literature-survey Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

MALT is a tool to perform literature surveys given a list of papers. Here we include stepwise procedures to replicate and update the database, create the webapplication and download pdf papers for further analysis.

Running Example: https://malware-analysis-survey.herokuapp.com/

# Features 
  - Query and Analyse a rich collection of publications for Automatic Malware Analysis.
  - Collect Bibliographical data of publications
  - Collect Author features like affiliation, interests and citations.

You can also:
  - Modify the scripts to do exploratory studies on different research topics.
  


### Tech

MALT uses a  couple of open source projects and APIs to work properly:

* [Scholarly](https://github.com/percolator/scholarly) - A python based scrapper to retrieve Google Scholar Data.

* [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/13501473) - An API to query DBLP

* [scidownl](https://pypi.org/project/scidownl/) - A python wrapper for Sci-Hub open API.

* [Django]

* [D3.js]

## 1.Database

The scripts are written for MySQL database. We use postgres for deployment on Heroku, you can follow the guidelines [here] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-mysql#:~:text=MySQL%20is%20a%20popular%20relational,that%20currently%20run%20on%20MySQL) to migrate.

Install and setup MySQL. 
- Follow the guidelines here (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) for installation.
- After installing, start the MySql Client

 ```sh
$ sudo mysql -u root
```
- Create a new database and switch to it.
```sh
mysql> Create database malt;
mysql> Use malt
```
- Import the database
```sh
mysql> source malt.sql 
```

## 2. Scripts

The script folder contains the Python 3.6 scrapper scripts used to collect bibliographical data. 
We also recommend using a VPN to perform multiple queries. Please use a VPN server from an English speaking country (US, UK, Canada). If you are a linux user we recommend using a free version of command line VPN, Windscribe (https://windscribe.com/guides/linux).


Install the required Python packages.

```sh
$ pip3 install requirements.txt
```

1.  [_googleScholar.py]:  Google Scholar to retrieve remaining attributes and check for papers in the citedBy. If paper is present in citedBy and our table, I inserted a row in the citedBy table. The citedBy results are stored in the JSON file.

```
Example: 
```sh
$ python3 first_google_scholar.py -c European Conference on Machine Learning  -t AI -i 0
```
Comment: Increment the value of i after every iteration till the total number of keywords is reached.

2.  [second_DBLP.py]: Used to query DBLP to retrieve additional attributes (Authors and DoI) and missing attribute (year and url).

```sh
$ python3 second_DBLP.py
```

3. : Used to collect fulltext version of papers given their DOI and convert them to text.
