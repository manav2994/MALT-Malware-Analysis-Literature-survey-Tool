# MALT: Malware Analysis Literature-survey Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

MALT is a tool to perform literature surveys given a list of papers. Here we include stepwise procedures to replicate and update the database, cretae the webapplication and download pdf papers for further analysis.

Running Example: https://malware-analysis-survey.herokuapp.com/

# Features 
  - Query and Analyse a rich collection of publications for Automatic Malware Analysis.
  - Collect Bibliographical data of publications pertaining to AI and Security in the provided conference/journal.
  - Collect Bibliographical data from a list of publications and check if they belong to our category.
  - Collect Author features like affiliation, interests and citations.


You can also:
  - Modify the scripts to do exploratory studies on different research topics.
  

### Tech

MALT uses a  couple of open source projects and APIs to work properly:

* [Scholarly](https://github.com/percolator/scholarly) - A python based scrapper to retrieve Google Scholar Data.

* [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/13501473) - An API to query DBLP

* [scidownl](https://pypi.org/project/scidownl/) - A python wrapper for Sci-Hub open API.


### Requirements

MALT is written in and is compatible with Python 3.6. 

Install the required Python packages.

```sh
$ pip3 install requirements.txt
```

## Setting and populating the database

Install and setup MySQL. 
- Follow the guidelines here (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) for installation.
- After installing, start the MySql Client

 ```sh
$ sudo mysql -u root
```
- Create a new database and switch to it.
```sh
mysql> Create database malt;
mysql> Use malt
```
- Import the database
```sh
mysql> source malt.sql 
```

We also recommend using a VPN to perform multiple queries. Please use a VPN server from an English speaking country (US, UK, Canada). If you are a linux user we recommend using a free version of command line VPN, Windscribe (https://windscribe.com/guides/linux).



## Scripts and Usage

Braise is currently using a collection of scripts to populate the database. Instructions on how to use them are given below.

1.  [_googleScholar.py]: Used to query Google Scholar using Conference/Journal name and a set of keywords.
```sh

```
Example: 
```sh
$ python3 first_google_scholar.py -c European Conference on Machine Learning  -t AI -i 0
```
Comment: Increment the value of i after every iteration till the total number of keywords is reached.

2.  [second_DBLP.py]: Used to query DBLP to retrieve additional attributes (Authors and DoI) and missing attribute (year and url).

```sh
$ python3 second_DBLP.py
```

3. 

Comment: [third_title2auth_v2.py] is similar to the previous one, but slightly less reliable. Use if the previous one doesnâ€™t generate all the results.

4.  One Time Scripts
* [papersFromAuthors.py] It retreives all the publications from a list of Authors and inserts the ones relevant for Braise
* [authorElements.py]  A utility script to retrieve Author related features like affiliation, total citations, interests.


## Web-Application


Django and D3.js


Heroku


## Paper Downloader



## Todos

 - Making the tool less Google Scholar Dependant (since no open APIs)
